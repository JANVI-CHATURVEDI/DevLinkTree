# 🌐 DevLinkTree 

A customizable "Link in Bio" tool that lets users visually build a personal profile layout — with support for adding images, notes, background styles, and social links. Built entirely using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

 ⚠️ This is a **frontend-only** project — it **does not use a backend** or localStorage (yet).
